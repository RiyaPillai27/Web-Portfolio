		Need of function
		================
		reusability of code
		Define it once and use it many times
		
		DRY: do not repeat yourself
		function:
		--------
it is block of code that is defined once and used
		many times by giving call to that block of code.
		
		Types of function:
		1)built-in function:
			the functions which are already defined in the 
			javascript are called as built-in functions.
			ex: parseInt(),prompt(),typeof(),etc
		2)user defined functions:
syntax:
			i)function definition-
				function functionname(arguments)
				{
					function body;
					return statement;		
				}
			ii) function call-
				functionname();
		working:
		1)function call is detected
		2)program control goes to function body
		3)it executes function body
		4)program control returns at the place of funciton call

		     { document.write("hello world ,good evening!!");}
			 greet(); //function calling
