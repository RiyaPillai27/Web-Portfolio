	 /* Disadvantage of code repetation:
	 1)length of program increases due to whivh 
	 debugging(erroe solving)
	 become difficult.
	 2) storage space to store program increses.
	 3) compiler or interpreter time is wasting in 
	 cheching same piece of code again and again.
	 
	 need of loop:
	 to overcome disadvantage of code repeatition,
	 we need loop control instruction or statement.
		
	what is loop?
	-------------
		the stement or instruction which allows us to write
		code once and repeat it finite or infinite no. of times.
        types of loop:
		1)while loop
		2)for loop
		3) do while loop
		
		while loop
		==========
		syntax:
			initialization
			while (condition){
				while code;
				increment/decrement;
				}
        working:
		==========
						initialization
						       |
							   |        False
					-------->condition ------> out of the loop
					|		   |
					|		   | True
					|		   |
